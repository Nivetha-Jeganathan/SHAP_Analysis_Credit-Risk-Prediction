# SHAP_Analysis_Credit-Risk-Prediction
This project applies explainable AI (XAI) techniques to a real-world credit risk prediction problem. Using customer financial data, a high-performing XGBoost model is trained to predict loan default probability.The project uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyze both global feature importance and individual loan decision explanations.
